<!- ---Units and sizes ---
        
    
    LENGTHS PART:

        1)The absolute value we use in css is px
        
        2)And its default value is 16px
        
        3)absolute font size can alter the users interests on font size settings

    PERCENTAGES PART:

     1) header{
                width:100%
        }
        h1{
                border: 2px dashed red;
                width: 50%;
        }

        here by placing width consecutively in both header and h1.It makes h1 to have an effect on the effected width by the header also here 100% is at default.
    
    RELATIVE PATH:

        1) rem (root element) - font sizeof root elem.
        whenever we place rem in font-size there is no effect on the elem by its parent elem but it does effected by root elem.
     
        2)em - using ems make the font to be amplified by the parent elem (If you have doubt listen at 1:01:37 sec)
     
        3)rem and em calc for padding
     
        font-size: 3rem;
        padding: 0.5em;

        here we divide (3rem/0.5em) we get = 1.5 rem

        basically  1em = 1.5 rem;

        since default value is 16 px

        so we get rem =16 px 

        i.e the padding length is 16*1.5 = 24 px
     

        4)ch(character width) - makes only certain no of char to exist before line wrap
        
        ex:width:40ch; makes only 40 ch to exist.
        
        5) vw and vh(view port width and view port height)

        listen at 1:08:24 sec to understand

        it mainly leads for showing scroll bar which is not uncomfortable.

        body{
        min-height: 100vh; makes body elem with whole height of the page.
        
        }
     ->

     <!- ---Box Model---
     
     *{
    margin: 0;
    padding:0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    } this is helpful for the default margin and it is easy to understand when changes are made.

    1)we can use border box and content box.

    but content box is only the lenght for the content so it does change the definition

    so we use border box which takes consideration of the content,padding and border length i.e if len= 400 then (content:364px,padding:16*2px,border:2*2px)

    margin does not include in the calculation.

    2)/*  margin-top: 1.5em;
    margin-right: 2em;
    margin-bottom: 2em;
    margin-left: 2em; creates an space all the sides (TSTMP:1:25:19)*/
    
    top right bottom left order is the way in which the effect takes place.
    margin: 1.5em 2em 2em 1.5em;
    i.e     

    same for the padding 
    padding: 1.5em 2em 3em 4em;
            

    same in the case of borders:

    border-top: 5px solid ;
    border-right: 10px dotted;
    or  if specificity is required
    border-top-width:5px
    border-top-style:5px
    border-top-color:5px


    Border TYPES:

    1)border : 1px double
    2)border : 1px outline
    2)border : 1px solid etc MDN LINK NEED TO BE PASTED ******

    border-radius : 50% to make it an circle.



     3)outline: 5px solid purple; ->does'nt come into calculation

     outline-offset: 5px; moves further 5px from the box. we can also make it negative so the outline comes inside the box model.

<!- --- Typorgraphy --- 

    It is the way the text gets arraged and presented 


    1.font: inherit;
    used to inherit the fonts from the parent
    since button and input tags are not effected when  font effect is applied to its parent we use it

    1.text-decoration:

        text-decoration: underline; - makes the line under the text.

        text-decoration: overline; - makes the line over the text.
 

        text-decoration: line-through; -  makes the line through the text.mainly use for span items.

        text-decoration: none; - no line effect is added it is mainly used in the cases of anchor tags.
 
    2.text-transform:
 
        text-transform: capitalize; - makes the starting letter of every word to be captilized.

        text-transform: lower case; - all letters lower case.

        text-transform: uppercase; - all letters uppercase.

    3.text-align:
    
        text-align: left; - text towards left.here the right side is not uniform


        text-align: justify; - it is used to justify the right text into uniform way.

        text-align: right;
        text towards right.here left side is not uniform.

    4.text-indent:2em; - here we use em's to indent the gap.

    NOTE: type text so you can get some recommendations

    5.line-height: 1.5; - increase the line of height.

        other than units it can even accept the numbers.It's default value is   1.2;
    6.letter-spacing: 0.1em; - increases space between letters.


    7.word-spacing: 0.5em; - increases space between words.
  
    8.font-properties:

        1.font-weight: 900; - it makes the text either to look bolder or lighter.

        it takes the values from 100 to 900. and also some other values like bold bolder lighter etc
        
          * 100 - lighter
          * 900 - bolder

        2.font-style: oblique; - makes a change in font style.
        it takes the values such as italic,none,etc.

        3.font-family: fantasy;
        makes a change in style of the font.

            it would take some other generic value such as 

                * san-serif
                *serif
                *monospace
                *cursive

            font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; - it is mainly used as an fallback so that if one text does'nt support the font then the next text will be enabled.
        
            * here we use "" if the font has space.

                some other famously use fonts are:

                1.font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

                2.font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;

                3.'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
    9.CSS LINKS:

        1.cursor: not-allowed;
        makes a change in cursor style when cursor is hovered onto the font.

        Note: if a link is used to visit a website it changes into purple color.

        else if it is not clicked then it is in blue color.

        2.Pseudo class: used to resemble the current state of the element.

            ex: a:visited {
                    color: purple;
                }

                a {
                text-decoration: none;
                cursor: pointer;
                color: blue;
                }

                a:hover {
                color: dodgerblue;
                }

                a:active {
                color: red;
                }


                //here visited class has more specificity than normal anchor tag. go and  check in specifcity calc.

                opacity: 0.8; it is used to add opacity to any selector so we need to use it wisely.

                or we can also use it with hsl by adding the 4th value

    10. Css Lists:

        1.list-style-type: lower-alpha; - it makes the bullet points style to change.

             it takes some other values such as 
             *georgian;
             *decimal;
             *decimal-leading-zero;
             *disc;
             *circle;
             *upper-roman etc.

        <li value="22">Step one</li> also used to have effect on bullet  points.  listen(2:31:45sec)

        2.text-align: center; - makes the text aligned to centre.

        but here the bullet points are not changed

        so we use list-style-position: inside; so that the bullets move towards left.

        here some browsers have outside as the default value.


         list-style-image: url(''); used  to add img as an checkpoint.

        list-style: square url(''); - used as an fallback so that if the img does not load the square gets into the play.

            li{
                color: red;
            } - makes all the lists in the ul an ol to red

            ul li{
                color: red;
            } - makes only the lists in ul to be red

            ul li:nth-child(2){
                color: red;
            } - makes the 2nd lists in the ul to be red

            ul li:nth-child(odd){
                color: red;
            }-makes the odd li's in ul to be red. and also even can be applied.

            li:last-child a{
                   border-radius: 0 0 2rem 2rem;
            }

            
            PSEUDO ELEM(IT ALWAYS HAS ::)::marker {
                color: red;
                font-family: fantasy;
                font-size: 1em;
                content: "Only 5$>>";
            } - it is mainly used to have effect on bullet points.
             
                and content tag is used to have text as an bullet.

                we can also add specificity by adding ol or ul.

                It makes the inline elem to block.
                li a{
                    display: block;
                }
}

    11.CSS Display:

                margin and height cannot be applied inline elements whereas padding can be applied.but it over laps 

                display: inline-block; -  helps in making some proprties applied on inline display.
 
                inline-block -  is used to 
}

    12.CSS Floats:

        1.div.block.right -  <div class="block right"></div>

        2.The container i.e section tag in this file enlarges based on the content but not on the basis of div class.

        3.This is needed to be rectified

        4.It can be done in 2 ways 
            1.overflow : auto; - makes the container to exist full so that the div element can exist i.e floated either left or right.

            2.but the correct way is
                display: flow-root;
                    previously used to create columns.

        Summary : so basically floats are used to float elements either to left or right based on the necessity.It can even be applied to containers.

    13.CSS COLUMNS :

        1.column-count: 4; - Makes 4 columns that is inscribed with text.

        2.column-width: 250px; - It describes colmns width so that based on the width the colmns gets created.

        3.Instead of above 2 steps we can apply in one step. i.e
            columns: 4 250px;

        4.column-rule: 3px solid black;

        5.column-gap: 3rem; - makes an extraspacing.

        6.margin collapsing - Need to be known!!!.

        7.break-inside: avoid; - It does'nt makes the header to split top and bottom.

        8.break-before: column; - it forces to have a column break
        but not a great property.

        9.resources for character entity references;
            1.unicode/table.com
            2.https://symbl.cc/en/

        10.column-span: all; - makes span for all columns

        11. .columns p{} has more specificity than
            .quote{} class selector.

        12. white-space: nowrap; - text does'nt shift singlely but does happen when grouped and by using this property.
